== Summary

This section will examine Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository integration with Amazon S3.

The workshop environment created an FSx for Lustre file system with a data repository integrated with the "nasanex" bucket in the US West (Oregon) region. link:https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/[NASA NEX] is a part of the link:https://registry.opendata.aws/[Registry of Open Data on AWS] project and is a collection of Earth science datasets maintained by NASA, including climate change projections and satellite images of the Earth's surface.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete this section.

TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the link above and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this github workshop and Amazon EC2 console.
+
. Make sure you are in the same *AWS Region* where you *_created_* your workshop environment.
. *_Select_* the EC2 instance created by the CloudFormation template. The name is "*Linux Instance 0*".
. *_Click_* the *Connect* button.
. *_Copy_* the SSH command and *_click_* *Close*.
. *_Open_* your *terminal* application and *_paste_* the SSH command in a terminal window.
. *_Follow_* the prompts to SSH into the instance.

time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.tif | wc -l
time lfs find /mnt/fsx --type f --name *.gz | wc -l

----
+
. How much metadata (MDT) has been loaded into the file system?
+
How much data (all the OSTs) has been loaded into the file system?
+
How much data storage capacity is available?
