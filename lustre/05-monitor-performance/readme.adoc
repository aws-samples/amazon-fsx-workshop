. Notice how the vertical time line is in sync across all widgets. This makes it easy to correlate different metric values for a given point in time.
. *_Zoom_* in on a widget by *_clicking_* and *_dragging_* over a period of time. Notice all widgets also zoom in for the period of time selected.
. *_Reset_* zoom by *_clicking_* the blue magnifying glass in the top right of any widget.
