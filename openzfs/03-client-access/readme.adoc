== Summary

This section will cover access to data on your *Amazon FSx for OpenZFS* volume from Linux and Windows instances using NFS protocol.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 5 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide (Access data from Linux Instance)

=== Connect to the Linux Instance

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console.
+
TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the link above and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this GitHub workshop and AWS console.
+
. Make sure you are in the same *AWS Region* as the workshop environment. If you need to change the *AWS Region* of the Amazon EC2 console, in the top right corner of the browser window *_click_* the region name next to *Support* and *_click_* the appropriate *AWS Region* from the drop-down menu.

. *_Click_* *Instances (running)*.

. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx for OpenZFS Workshop Linux Instance*.

. *_Click_* the Connect button.

* Connect using AWS Systems Manager - *_Select_* *Session Manager* tab and *_click_* the Connect button to open a session in your browser. (*recommended*)

* SSH using Terminal client - *_Select_* *SSH client* tab and *_Copy_* the Example SSH command shown and *_click_* Close.

** *_Open_* your terminal application and *_paste_* the SSH command in a terminal window.

** *_Follow_* the prompts to SSH into the instance.

=== Access data on Linux Instance

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

. *_Run_* the following command to check what NFS volumes have been mounted.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount | grep  nfs
----
+

. Do you see any NFS volumes have been mounted?
+
NOTE: You should see the *sync_vol* and *async_vol* volumes created by the workshop environment already mounted.
+

. *_Examine_* the mount options from the output of the *mount* command. What NFS version is used by default?
+
TIP: Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file systems support accessing data from a wide variety of compute instances and operating systems using the Network File System (NFS) protocol (v3, v4.0, v4.1 and v4.2)
+

. *_Run_* below command to examine the size and available space for both volumes.
+
[source,bash]
----
df -h /fsxasync /fsxsync
----
+

. Why are the sizes different even thought both volumes have a quota of 1024 GiB?
+
TIP: The async_vol has a space reservation of 100 GiB which guarantees this space is always available for this volume. Due to this the sync_vol only sees the remaining capacity available on the file system.
+

. *_Run_* command below to list the contents of the NFS mounts.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -lt /fsxasync /fsxsync
----
+

. *_Run_* command below to view the contents of the file created by the workshop environment.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat /fsxsync/demofile01.txt
----

. Go back to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console, *_Click_* *Instances (running)*

. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx for OpenZFS Workshop Windows Instance*.

. *_Copy_* the *Public DNS (IPv4)* name of the *FSx for OpenZFS Workshop Windows Instance*.

. Launch your remote desktop application and create a new connection.
* Windows Users - use the built-in *Remote Desktop Connection* application.
* Mac Users - use the link:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12/[Microsoft Remote Desktop] app available from the Mac App Store.

. Use the DNS name copied above as the host name of the new connection.

. Start a remote desktop session to the new connection. 

. Login using the *Administrator* user.

. To get the *Administrator* password, *_Select_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx for OpenZFS Workshop Windows Instance* and *_Click_* *Connect*. *_Click_* on the *RDP client* tab and then *Click* on *Get password*. In the Get Windows password window, *_Click_* on *Browse* to browse the key pair associated with this instance, *_Select_* the key pair and *_Click_* *Open*. Next, *_Click_* *Decrypt Password* and *_Copy_* the Password. *_Paste_* the copied password in your remote desktop session window to complete the login process.


=== Access data on Windows Instance

. *_Return_* to the browser tab for your for Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume with name *sync_vol* and *_Click_* *Attach* on the top right corner. On the *Attach file system* window, *_Click_* on *From Windows instances*, copy the *mount* command listed under *_Attach instruction_*

. *_Return_* to the remote desktop session of the *FSx for OpenZFS Workshop Windows Instance*. *_Open_* a *command prompt* and paste the mount command you copied in previous step. 
+
NOTE: The NFS client has already been installed by the workshop environment.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount \\<DNSNAME>\fsx\sync_vol\ Z:
----
+
[source,bash]
----
mount \\fs-01234515abdcefgh.fsx.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\fsx\sync_vol\ Z:
----
+

. *_Launch_* *File Explorer*.

. In the *File Explorer* window of the Z: drive you should see the file *demofile01.txt* which was created by the workshop environment.

. *_Double-Click_* to open the file *demofile01.txt*  and view the contents of the file.
