=== Deploy the Amazon FSx File Gateway environment using AWS CloudFormation

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before *_clicking_* the *Deploy to AWS* button.

. Click on the *Deploy to AWS* button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin. To simulate a real-world scenario of deploying the FSx File Gateway remote from the FSx for Windows File Server, select a region below that is different than the region you selected in Phase 1.
+
TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the *Deploy to AWS* button and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this github tutorial and the AWS Console.

+
. *_Select_* *Save routes* and *Close*.

=== Deploy an Amazon Windows EC2 instance in Region 2 using AWS CloudFormation that automatically joins the AWS-managed Active Direction in Region 2

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before *_clicking_* the *Deploy to AWS* button.

. Click on the *Deploy to AWS* button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin. This should be the same region you selected above for Region 2.
