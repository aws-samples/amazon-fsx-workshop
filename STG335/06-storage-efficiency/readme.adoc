== Summary

This section will cover Storage Efficiency features that can be enabled on your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* file system.


==== Storage Efficiency features overview


. *Compression*: Compresses data blocks to eliminate the amount of physical storage required.
. *Deduplication*: Eliminates duplicate data blocks to achieve storage efficiency and optimize cost. You can enable Inline and post-process deduplication for your volume. 
. *Compaction*: Aggregates multiple small file IO operations and IO operations that are padded with zeros into a single 4KB block on disk. For example, if you have small file IO (<4KB) instead of allocating one 4KB block to each IO, Compaction will aggregate multiple smaller IO operations into a single 4KB block.


You can enable or disable these *Storage Efficiency* features for your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* at the volume level. You can use deduplication, data compression, and data compaction together or independently to achieve optimal space savings on a volume. With all three features enabled, new data written to the volume will:

* First, will compress incoming data blocks using Inline data compression.
* Second, will remove duplicate blocks using Inline deduplication.
* Third, will compact smaller IO's (<4KB) that may or may not be already compressed and deduplicated into 4KB block before writing to your file system using Inline data compaction.

== Examine storage efficiency settings


. *_Return_* to the SSH connection of your *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux instance* and SSH to the cluster management endpoint of your FSx for ONTAP file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----
+
. *_Run_* below command to check if storage efficiency is enabled on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency show
----
+
. *_Examine_* the fields *State* and *Policy*. 
+
NOTE: All volumes are assigned the *auto* efficiency policy. The auto policy performs continuous deduplication in the background and runs when 20% of the data is changed on your volume. If required, you can assign a custom policy and a schedule for your post-process deduplication jobs.
+
. *_Run_* below command to check which storage efficiency features are enabled or disabled on your volume. 
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency show -vserver svm01 -volume vol1
----
+

. *_Examine_* the following fields. 
* Efficiency Policy Name
* Inline Compression
* Inline Dedupe
* Data Compaction

. *_Run_* the below command to check the storage efficiency savings for your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume show -vserver svm01 -volume vol1 -fields compression-space-saved,compression-space-saved-percent,dedupe-space-saved,dedupe-space-saved-percent
----
+

. Do you see any deduplication savings?

+
. *_Run_* the below command to view statistics of efficiency operations on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency stat -vserver svm01 -volume vol1
----
+

. *_Return_* to the SSH connection of your *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux instance*
+
[source,bash]
----
quit
