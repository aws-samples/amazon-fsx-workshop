. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor.
+
[source,bash]
----
$WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint = "windows_remote_powershell_endpoint" # e.g. "fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com"
enter-pssession -ComputerName ${WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint} -ConfigurationName FsxRemoteAdmin

----
+

. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - SAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com).

. Return to your favorite text editor and replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* with the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of *STG326 - SAZ*. *_Copy_* the updated script.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.

. *_Run_* the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

+
NOTE: Complete the next few steps using the remote PowerShell session to the FSx file server.
+

. Review the PowerShell function commands for data deduplication available using the *Amazon FSx CLI for remote management on PowerShell*.
* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-Command *-FSxDedup*
----
+

. What commands are available?

. Enable data depduplication for the entire FSx file system.
* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Enable-FSxDedup
----
+

. Examine your data deduplication environment using the commands in the table below.

+
|===
| *Command*
| Get-FSxDedupConfiguration

| Get-FSxDedupStatus

| Get-FSxDedupJob

| Get-FSxDedupMetadata

| Get-FSxDedupSchedule

| Measure-FSxDedupFileMetadata -path "D:\share"

|===
+

* Were all these commands successful? Why not?
* When is the next scheduled "Optimization" task?

. End the remote PowerShell session. *_Run_* *Exit-PSSession*.

. Close the PowerShell window. *_Run_* *exit*.


=== Create new data deduplication optimization schedule

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before continuing.

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor.
+
[source,bash]
----
$WindowsRemotePowerShellEndpoint = "windows_remote_powershell_endpoint" # e.g. "fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com"

----
+

. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - SAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of the file system to the clipboard (e.g. fs-0123456789abcdef.example.com).

. Return to your favorite text editor and replace *"windows_remote_powershell_endpoint"* with the *Windows Remote PowerShell Endpoint* of *STG326 - SAZ*. *_Copy_* the updated script.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.

. *_Run_* the updated script in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

IMPORTANT: Complete the next few steps using the remote PowerShell session to the FSx file server.

. Create a new data deduplication optimization schedule.

* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
New-FSxDedupSchedule
----
+

* Use the table values when prompted.

+
|===
| *Prompt* | *Value*
| Name
| DailyOptimization

| Type
| Optimization

|===
+

. What time will the optimization start?

. Examine the different options available to data deduplication jobs.
* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupSchedule -?
----
+

. *_Copy_* the command below into your favorite text editor and update the *start_time* parameter with the current time plus 2 minutes. Look at the clock in bottom right corner of the remote desktop window. Add 2 minutes to this time and replace the *start_time* parameter with this value. (i.e. 5:32pm). This time is in UTC.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupSchedule -Name DailyOptimization -Start start_time
----
+

* Run the updated command in the *Windows PowerShell* window.

* Wait for the time of the DailyOptimization scheduled job to pass (i.e. 1 minute after the start_time you entered above) and run the command below to check the status.

* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupStatus
----
+

. Did the optimization schedule run?

* Look at the LastOptimizationTime value of the Get-FSxDedupStatus output.

. How many files were optimized and how much space is saved?

* Find the corresponding Get-FSxDedupStatus output for the command attributes in the table below

+
|===
| *Attribute*
| LastOptimizationResult

| OptimizedFilesCount

| OptimizedFilesSavingsRate

| OptimizedFilesSize

| SavedSpace
|===
+

. Do you see any optimization? Why not?

. Quickly read the *_Enabling data deduplication_* section of the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-data-dedup.html[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide] to find the answer.

* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupConfiguration
----
+

. What is the MinimumFileAgeDays attribute value?

. Update the data deduplication configuration and set the minimum file age days attribute to 0.

* *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Set-FSxDedupConfiguration -MinimumFileAgeDays 0
----
+

. Update the DailyOptimization data deduplication schedule to run in 2 minutes.

. *_Copy_* the command below into your favorite text editor and update the *start_time* parameter with the current time plus 2 minutes. Look at the clock in bottom right corner of the remote desktop window. Add 2 minutes to this time and replace the *start_time* parameter with this value. (i.e. 5:32pm)

+
[source,bash]

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupStatus

+

. Did the optimization schedule run?
* Look at the LastOptimizationTime value of the Get-FSxDedupStatus output.

. The active data deduplication job may still be running. *_run_* the following command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session* to check on the status of the data deduplication job.
+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupJob
----
+

. Continue to re-run the Get-FSxDedupJob command every few minutes to check on the status of the job. This may take 5-10 minutes depending on the amount of data you creating during the *test performance* section.

. Continue with the workshop while the data deduplication job runs in the background.

. If the Get-FSxDedupJob command returns an error, then there are no more active jobs and the job has completed.

. *_Run_* the command in the *Remote Windows PowerShell Session*.

+
[source,bash]
----
Get-FSxDedupStatus
