. From the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *STG326 - SAZ* file system and *_select_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Copy_* the *DNS Name* of the file system to the clipboard.

. Go to the remote desktop session for your *Windows Instance 0*.

. *_Click_* *Start*.

. *_Type_* *fsmgmt.msc*.

. From the *Shared Folders* Console, *_select_* *Action* >> *Connect to another computer...*.

. *_Paste_* the *DNS Name* copied above in the *Another computer:* text box and *_click_* *Ok*.

. From the left pane *_select_* *Open Files*.

. Review the open files of the file system.

. Keep the Shared Folders Console open.

. *_Click_* *Start* >> *Windows PowerShell*.
+
IMPORTANT: This section assumes that *STG326 - SAZ* is mapped as the *Z:/* drive. If your *Windows Instance 0* does not have a mapped *Z:/* drive, map *STG326 - SAZ* as the *Z:/* drive (see the previous section for step-by-step instructions).
+
. Run the DiskSpeed script below to test read performance of the mapped **Z:** drive.
+
```sh
$random = $(Get-Random)
fsutil file createnew Z:\${env:computername}-$random.dat 100000000000
C:\Tools\DiskSpd-2.0.21a\amd64\DiskSpd.exe -d120 -w0 -r -t1 -o32 -b64K -Su -L Z:\${env:computername}-$random.dat
```
+
. While the script is running, go back to the *Shared Folders* Console and refresh the *Open Files* view.

. Do you see an open file?
+
TIP: Check your email. You should eventually get a High Throughput Alarm email.
+
. *_Context-click (right-click)_* the new open file (e.g. D:\share\EC2AMAZ-xxxxxx-xxxxx.dat) and *_select_* *Close Open File*. *_Select_* *Yes* at the prompt window.

. What happened to the open file?

. What happened to the DiskSpd command in the PowerShell window?

. Close the PowerShell window. *_Run_* *exit*.

. Close the *Shared Folders* Console.
