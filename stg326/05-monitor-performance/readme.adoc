. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/[Amazon CloudWatch] console.
+
TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the link above and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this github workshop and AWS console.
+
NOTE: The pre-built workshop environment was built in the *Ohio (us-east-2) AWS Region*. Make sure you are in the *Ohio (us-east-2) AWS Region*.
+
. *_Select_* *Dashboards* from the left navigation pane.
. *_Select_* the link of the dashboard created as a part of the workshop environment.
+
TIP: The name of the dashboard should be the region name (e.g. us-east-2), dash (-), file system id of *STG326 - SAZ* (e.g. us-east-2-fs-0123456789abcdef).
. *_Scroll_* through the dashboard and review all the widgets and their settings.
. Notice how the vertical time line is in sync across all widgets. This makes it easy to correlate different metric values for a given point in time.
. *_Zoom_* in on a widget by *_clicking_* and *_dragging_* over a period of time. Notice all widgets also zoom in for the period of time selected.
. *_Reset_* zoom by *_clicking_* the blue magnifying glass in the top right of any widget.


=== CloudWatch alarm

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before *_creating_* the alarm.

. *_Copy_* the file system id from the top right dashboard widget.
. *_Click_* the *Maximize* button of the *Throughput (Bytes per second)* widget.
. *_Click_* the *View in metrics* link (at the bottom left of the window).
. *_Find_* the metric labeled *Total Data Throughput (B/s)* and *_click_* the *Create alarm* button (bell icon) in the actions column.
. *_Scroll_* down to the *Conditions* section. *_Accept_* the default *Threshold type* and *Greater* alarm condition and in the *Define the threshold value* field *_enter_* 200000000. This will set an alarm condition that will trigger if the *Total Data Throughput (B/s)* is greater than 200 MB/s.
. *_Click_* *Next*.
. *_Click_* *Create new topic*.
. In the *Create new topic...* field, *_enter_* *High_Throughput_* then *_paste_* the file system id.
. In the *Email endpoints that will receive the notification...* field, *_enter_* an email address that you have access to right now.
. *_Click_* *Create topic*.
. *_Click_* *Next*.
. Give the alarm a name like *High_Throughput_* then *_paste_* the file system id.
. *_Click_* *Next*.
. *_Scroll_* to the bottom and *_click_* *Create alarm*.
. The email address you entered earlier will receive an *AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation* email. *_Open_* the email and *_click_* *Confirm subscription*.
. *_Wait_* a few minutes for the alarm state to transition from *Insufficient data* to *OK*.
. *_Return_* to the previous workshop section *Test performance* and run a few more read and write performance tests against the file system. Make sure the duration of the test is at least 2 minutes.
* Did your *High throughput alarm* get triggered?
* Did your email address receive an alarm notification?
