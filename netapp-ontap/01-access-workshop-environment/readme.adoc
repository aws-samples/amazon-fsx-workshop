== Summary

Deploy a new AWS environment for use during this workshop. See the *Workshop Diagram* below. The launch template will create  1 x Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP multi-AZ file system (*Primary*) in *VPC A* and 1 x Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP single-AZ file system (*DR/Secondary*) in *VPC B*. The launch template will configure VPC peering between VPC A and VPC B, create Cluster peering and SVM peering between the FSx file systems, and establish a SnapMirror relationship to replicate data between the two file systems.

The launch template will also create additonal resources like AWS NAT Gateways, VPC Interface Endpoints, Lambda, Microsoft AD, Compute (Windows and Linux EC2 instances), Secrets Manager, SVM(Storage Virtual Machines), Volumes etc. required to complete this workshop.


It will take approximately 60-90 minutes for the workshop environment to be created.
