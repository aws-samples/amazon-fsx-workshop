== Summary

This section will cover the data protection technologies available with *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* file system.

. *Snapshots*: A read-only, point in time copy of your volume that can be used for near instantaneous backups and short-term recovery. 
. *Amazon FSx Backups*: A cost-efficient offsite backup of your volume that is stored in highly durable storage within the same region. 
. *SnapMirror Vault*: Disk based backup technology for performing offsite backups of your volume snapshots to a *secondary* file system in the same or different region.
. *SnapMirror*: Native block level replication technology for disaster recovery and data migrations. We will cover this feature in our disaster recovery section of this workshop.
. *SnapLock*: Built-in write once, read many (WORM) capability allowing organizations to retain files in non-modifiable and non-erasable state for regulatory and governance compliance.

=== Snapshots Overview

When a new snapshot is created, it creates new pointers to existing blocks on the volume. Since no data is copied, snapshots do not consume any space on creation and are nearly instantaneous. As data blocks on your volume get modified or deleted, the blocks locked by the snapshot are retained and the snapshot starts to consume space over time. 

Snapshots are recommended for short-term recovery and provide the ability to restore a single file, directory or entire volume using the point in time copy. Since snapshots are stored along side your volume, they are not ideal for long-term and offsite backup and do not protect against volume or file system failures. You can schedule automatic snapshots using a snapshot policy and also trigger manual snapshots. 


=== Amazon FSx Backups Overview

Amazon FSx backups allow you to take highly durable automatic daily backups or user-initiated backups of your volume all stored within highly durable storage in the same region. These backups are incremental and the automatic daily backups can be scheduled to run during a daily backup window with a retention period between 0-90 days.  You can also initiate a manual backup of a volume at any time.  These user initiated backups never expire and are retained even after the volume or file system is deleted.

Since no additional infrastructure needs to be provisioned with Amazon FSx backups, you get cost-effective offsite backups with a retention period up to 90 days.  If more fine grained policies are needed or retention periods longer than 90 days, you can utilize link:https://aws.amazon.com/backup/[AWS Backup] with your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.


=== SnapMirror Vault Overview

SnapMirror Vault is a disk-based storage backup feature in ONTAP, which allows you to backup snapshot copies of your volume to a *secondary* volume on a different file system for long-term retention. You can restore data from the SnapMirror Vault *secondary* volume to the associated source volume or to a different volume. The snapshot policy assigned to the source volume determines when snapshots are created. A SnapMirror Vault policy assigned to the SnapMirror Vault relationship determines which snapshots on the source volume are replicated to the *secondary* volume. Storage efficiencies if enabled are preserved.

SnapMirror Vault can be used to backup volumes from multiple source file systems to a central *secondary* system for offsite backups in same or different region. 

SnapMirror Vault uses the SnapMirror engine, so replication works exactly the same way. 

NOTE: SnapMirror Vault will not be covered in this workshop.

=== SnapLock Overview

SnapLock is the write once, read many (WORM) capability built into the ONTAP operating system.  SnapLock can be used to meet regulatory compliance, help protect business-critical data from ransomware attacks, and provide an additional layer of protection for your data against alteration or deletion.  With SnapLock you can protect your files by transitioning them to a WORM state making them immutable for a specified retention period.  You can either accept the default SnapLock retention period for the volume or you can manually set a retention period on a per file basis by updating the atime of the file between the minimum and maximum retention periods for the volume.  Your files can be committed to WORM protection automatically by FSx for NetApp ONTAP or manually on a per file basis.  Both the Compliance and Enterprise modes of SnapLock are supported with FSx for NetApp ONTAP.  Tiering of SnapLock protected data to the capacity pool is also supported.

NOTE: When you close an AWS account that contains SnapLock Enterprise or Compliance volumes, AWS and FSx for ONTAP suspend your account for 90 days with your data intact. If you don't reopen your account during those 90 days, AWS deletes your data including data in SnapLock volumes regardless of your retention settings.

[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----
+

. *_Run_* command below to check for available snapshots.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume snapshot show
----
+

. *_Run_* below command to check the default snapshot policy that is enabled on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
snapshot policy show -policy default
----
+

NOTE: You can see the default schedule in the output which retains a total of 10 snapshots *(6 hourly, 2 daily and 2 weekly)*.  

. *_Run_* below command to check the timings for the various schedules:
+
[source,bash]
----
job schedule cron show
----
+
NOTE: As you can see the hourly snapshots happen 5 mins past the hour, the daily snapshots 10 mins past midnight and weekly snapshots 15 mins past midnight on Sunday.

. *_Run_* command below to trigger a *manual* snapshot for your volume. Provide a snapshot name *vol1_primary_FSxOntapWorkshop*  and a comment as shown below.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume snapshot create -vserver svm01-primary -volume vol1_primary -snapshot vol1_primary_FSxOntapWorkshop -comment "Manual Snapshot created for FSx Workshop"
----
+

. *_Run_* command below to list the snapshots.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume snapshot show vol1_primary
----
+

. *_Run_* below command to check the snapshot snapreserve space assigned to the volume:
+
[source,bash]
----
volume show vol1_primary -fields percent-snapshot-space,snapshot-space-used
----
+

. Alternately, you can also *_run_* the below command to check the snapshot snapreserve space usage on the volume:
+
[source,bash]
----
df -h vol1_primary
----
+

NOTE: By default *5%* of the volume space is configured for *_snapreserve_* and this value can be modified. If the snapshot space used exceeds the 5% snapreserve, then snapshots will start consuming space in the data area of your volume.

. *_Run_* the command below to quit the ONTAP CLI session.
+
[source,bash]
----
quit
----
+

. Next, lets make some changes to the text file created in the multiprotocol access section of the workshop. *_Run_* the below command to make the changes to the text file. 
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/multiprotocol-demo.txt
echo "Appending text before single file restore" >> ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/multiprotocol-demo.txt
cat ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/multiprotocol-demo.txt
----
+
. We are now going to restore the previous version of the file. *_Restore_* the previous version of the file from the snapshot taken earlier in this workshop.  You can overwrite the file in its original location or copy the file to a new location. Lets create a new directory to restore this file.
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/restore
----
+

. *_Change directory_* to the *_.snapshot_* directory and list snapshots available for restore. *_Change directory_* to the the snapshot *vol1_primary_FSxOntapWorkshop* directory that corresponds to the manual snapshot created earlier and copy the file from the snapshot to the target directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/.snapshot
ls
cd vol1_primary_FSxOntapWorkshop/
ls
cat multiprotocol-demo.txt
cp -p multiprotocol-demo.txt ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/restore/
cd
----
+
. *_cat_* the restored file to view its contents.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/restore/multiprotocol-demo.txt
----
+
. Was the file successfully restored to a previous point in time?

+
TIP: To *perform* an entire volume restore from snapshot you can run *volume snapshot restore -vserver <SVM> -volume <Volume> -snapshot <snapshot name>* from your ONTAP CLI session. 

.  *_Return_* to the RDP session to your Windows instance opened through *Systems Manager Fleet Manager*.

. Using *File explorer*, *_right-click_* on the file *multiprotocol-demo.txt*, *_select_* *properties*, and *_click_* on *Previous Versions* tab to browse for available snapshots.  *_Double-click_* on the version of the file shown under *File versions:* to view the contents.  *_Click_* *Restore* to restore to a previous point in time.

. Were you able to restore the file?

. *_Return_* to the *Session* Manager connection of your *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance* and *_run_* the command below to SSH to the cluster management endpoint of your *Primary* FSx for ONTAP file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----
+

. *_Run_* the command below to check the security style for your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume show -volume vol1_primary -fields security-style
----
+

NOTE: Your volume inherited the *Unix* security style from the SVM and enforces Unix style permissions. ONTAP performs name mapping between Windows and Unix users to authorize access. If a Windows user tries to access a Unix security style volume their Windows username will be mapped to Unix UID because a Unix security style volume will not understand its Windows username. The Unix user will be verified by /etc/password files, NIS or LDAP.  Administrators can configure explicit manual mapping from a Windows user to Unix user. For example a windows user "john" is mapped to Unix user "john" to identify the permissions and authorize access. if no mappings are found then its mapped to *pcuser* with UID and GID 65634.  You were denied access because you were trying overwrite a file owned by Unix user *ssm-user* as *admin* user from Windows. To learn more about user mapping and multiprotocol best practices refer link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/27436-tr-4887.pdf[Multiprotocol NAS in NetApp ONTAP]

. *_Run_* the command below to quit the ONTAP CLI session.

----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----

. *_Run_* the command below to review the SnapLock configuration of the two SnapLock volumes on the *Primary* FSx for ONTAP file system.  Make note of the auto commit period, minimum retention period, default retention period, and maximum retention period for both volumes.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume snaplock show -vserver svm01-primary -volume vol_sl_* -instance
----

. *_Run_* the command below to quit the ONTAP CLI session.
+
[source,bash]
----
quit
----

. On the *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance*, *_run_* the commands below to make the local directories and mount the SnapLock volumes.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo mkdir $SLAUTO $SLMANUAL
sudo mount -t nfs ${NFSENDPOINT}:/vol_sl_auto ${SLAUTO}
sudo mount -t nfs ${NFSENDPOINT}:/vol_sl_manual ${SLMANUAL}
sudo chown ssm-user:ssm-user /sl_auto
sudo chown ssm-user:ssm-user /sl_manual
----

. *_Run_* the commands below to create a file that will be automatically committed to WORM protection and made immutable on the vol_sl_auto volume.  SnapLock will automatically commit the file to WORM protection within the *Autocommit Period* for this volume you observed in the earlier step.  Make note of the output from the date command to ensure 5 minutes have passed in a later step.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /sl_auto
echo "This file will be automatically WORM protected via SnapLock after 5 minutes due to the Autocommit Period on the vol_sl_auto volume being set to 5 minutes." >> auto.txt
date
----

. Next create some files which will be manually committed to WORM protection.  *_Run_* the commands below to create two files.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /sl_manual
echo "This file will be manually WORM protected via SnapLock accepting the default retention period on the volume." >> manual_default.txt
echo "This file will be manually WORM protected via SnapLock with a custom retention period." >> manual_custom.txt
----

. *_Run_* the command below to update the atime of the manual_custom.txt file and manually set the WORM retention period to 1 hour from now.
+
[source,bash]
----
touch -a -d '1 hour' /sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
----

. *_Run_* the commands below to mark the files as read-only and commit them to WORM protection.  The manual_custom.txt file will use the retention period of one hour from now as it was manually set by updating the atime in the previous step.  The manual_default.txt file will receive the default retention period of the volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod 444 /sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
chmod 444 /sl_manual/manual_default.txt
----

. Now that the files have been committed to WORM protection and made immutable, *_run_* the commands below to try and change the permissions back to read/write.
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod 755 /sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
chmod 755 /sl_manual/manual_default.txt
----
+
These commands fail as these files are immutable until their retention periods have expired and the WORM protection is removed.

. *_Run_* the commands below to try and append additional data to the end of these files.
+
[source,bash]
----
echo "Trying to append data to the WORM protected file." >> /sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
echo "Trying to append data to the WORM protected file." >> /sl_manual/manual_default.txt
----
+
These commands also fail as the files still contain read-only permissions which can't be changed until the retention periods have expired and the WORM protection is removed.

. *_Run_* the commands below to try and remove the SnapLock protected files from the file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -f /sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
rm -f /sl_manual/manual_default.txt
----
+
These commands also fail as the files are WORM protected and can not be deleted from the file system until the retention period has been met.

. *_Run_* the command below to SSH to the cluster management endpoint of your **Primary** FSx for ONTAP file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----

. *_Run_* the command below to view the retention period expiration for the file which was manually committed to WORM protection, and accepted the default retention period for the volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume file retention show -vserver svm01-primary -file /vol/vol_sl_manual/manual_default.txt
----

. *_Run_* the command below to view the retention period expiration for the file which was manually committed to WORM protection, and the retention period was manually set for 1 hour from now.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume file retention show -vserver svm01-primary -file /vol/vol_sl_manual/manual_custom.txt
----

. *_Run_* the command below to view the retention period expiration for the file which was automatically committed to WORM protection without any interaction on our part.  If the file does not yet show a retention period ensure that 5 minutes have past since the output of the date command in a previous step.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume file retention show -vserver svm01-primary -file /vol/vol_sl_auto/auto.txt
----

. *_Run_* the command below to quit the ONTAP CLI session.
+
[source,bash]
----
quit
