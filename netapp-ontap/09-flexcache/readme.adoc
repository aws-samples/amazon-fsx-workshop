== Summary

This section will cover the how you can setup FlexCache on your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* file system, cache only the actively-read data instead of copying entire datasets or volumes. You can use FlexCache to:

* Increase throughput for read-intensive applications like Seismic analysis, media rendering workflows, chip design, financial simulation etc.
* Provide low-latency access to data in your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system from another region and extend your workflows across multiple AWS regions or to on-premises NetApp environments.
* Burst your workloads to Cloud by creating a FlexCache volume on the FSx file system and link it to a origin volume on your on-premises NetApp storage.


=== FlexCache Overview

A FlexCache volume is a sparsely populated volume that acts as a cache for your source volume also referred as origin volume and stores frequently accessed data. If a file is not available in the FlexCache volume its read from the origin volume and served to clients. Subsequent access to data will be faster at lower latencies.

Media Rendering, Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Financial applications and other use cases often need generated in one region to be accessed from compute instances or end user workstations in another region at lower latencies. While data can be replicated to another volume in second region to make it available locally, this is not ideal (duplication of data, additional infrastructure, replication delays administration overhead etc.)  Instead, You can use FlexCache volume to speed up access to data or to offload traffic for read-intensive volumes. You can have FlexCache volume in same file system to accelerate performance for frequently accessed data or distribute data across multiple file systems in another region to reduce WAN latencies. You can create a FlexCache volume on FSx, linked to a origin volume located on-premises NetApp storage and burst to cloud, or you can create a FlexCache volume in different AWS region/on-premises NetApp filer and link it to a origin volume on FSx to provide low latency access to data.

=== Verify cluster peering relationships

=== Create FlexCache 

TIP: To learn more about FlexCache best practices refer link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/7336-tr4743pdf.pdf[FlexCache Best Practices]

+
[source,bash]

volume flexcache create -vserver svm01 -volume cachevol -aggr-list aggr1 -size 100G -origin-vserver svm08 -origin-volume vol1 -aggr-list-multiplier 2
----
+
. *_Verify_* the FlexCache relationship from your *secondary* file system.
+
[source,bash]
----

vol show -volume vol1 -fields logical-used,physical-used
----
+
. *_Run_* below ONTAP CLI command to check the *logical* and *physical* space used on the source volume from your *secondary* file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
vol show -volume cachevol -fields logical-used,physical-used
----
+
. Are they identical?

. *_Run_* below ONTAP CLI command to check the pre-populate a file from your *secondary* file system. *_Enter_* *y* when prompted to continue in advanced privilege mode. Replace the file path *1GB/file_srcdir/ip-10-0-0-17.us-east-2.compute.internal/thrd_00/d_000/_ip-10-0-0-17.us-east-2.compute.internal_00_1_* with the path on your Linux instance. You will find this under *${MOUNTPOINT}* directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
set -privilege advanced
flexcache prepopulate start -cache-volume cachevol -path-list 1GB/file_srcdir/ip-10-0-0-17.us-east-2.compute.internal/thrd_00/d_000/_ip-10-0-0-17.us-east-2.compute.internal_00_1_
set -privilege admin
----
