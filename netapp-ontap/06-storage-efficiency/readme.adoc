== Summary

This section will cover Storage Efficiency features that can be enabled on your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* file system.


=== Storage Efficiency features Overview


. *Compression*: Compresses data blocks to eliminate the amount of physical storage required.
. *Deduplication*: Eliminates duplicate data blocks to achieve storage efficiency and optimize cost. You can enable Inline and post-process deduplication for your volume. 
. *Compaction*: Aggregates multiple small file IO operations and IO operations that are padded with zeros into a single 4KB block on disk. For example, if you have small file IO (<4KB) instead of allocating one 4KB block to each IO, Compaction will aggregate multiple smaller IO operations into a single 4KB block.


You can enable or disable these *Storage Efficiency* features for your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* volumes. You can run deduplication, data compression, and data compaction together or independently to achieve optimal space savings on a volume. With all three features enabled, when new data is written to your volume:

* First, Inline data compression will compress incoming data blocks.
* Next, Inline deduplication will remove duplicate blocks.
* Next, Inline data compaction will compact smaller IO's (<4KB) that may or may not be already compressed and deduplicated into 4KB block before writing to your file system.

== Step-by-step Guide (Storage Efficiency)

=== Storage Efficiency Features

. *_Run_* the command below to SSH to the cluster management endpoint of your *Primary* FSx for ONTAP file system.
+
TIP: If the Session Manager window has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the  session window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. Connect using AWS Systems Manager - *_Select_* *Session Manager* tab and *_click_* the Connect button to open a session in your browser.  Change the shell back to bash by typing the command ***bash*** and then return.
+

+
[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----
+
. *_Run_* the below command to check if Storage Efficiency is enabled on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency show
----
+
. *_Examine_* the fields *State* and *Policy*. 
+
NOTE: All volumes are assigned the *auto* efficiency policy by default when storage efficiency is enabled. The auto policy performs continuous deduplication in the background and runs when 20% of the data is changed on your volume. If required, you can assign a custom policy and a schedule for your post-process deduplication jobs.
+
. *_Run_* the below command to check which Storage Efficiency features are enabled or disabled on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency show -vserver svm01-primary -volume vol1_primary
----
+

. *_Examine_* the following fields. 
* Efficiency Policy Name
* Inline Compression
* Inline Dedupe
* Data Compaction

. *_Run_* the below command to check the Storage Efficiency savings for your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume show -vserver svm01-primary -volume vol1_primary -fields compression-space-saved,compression-space-saved-percent,dedupe-space-saved,dedupe-space-saved-percent
----
+

. Do you see any deduplication savings?

+
. *_Run_* the below command to view statistics of efficiency operations on your volume.
+
[source,bash]
----
volume efficiency stat -vserver svm01-primary -volume vol1_primary
----
+

. *_Run_* the command below to quit the ONTAP CLI session.
+
[source,bash]
----
quit
----
