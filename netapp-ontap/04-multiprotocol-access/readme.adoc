== Summary

This section will cover multiprotocol access to data on your *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* volume from Linux and Windows instances. 

You will mount the volume using NFS protocol from the Linux instance. Next, You will create a *_SMB share_* on the same volume and map it from the Windows instance, and experience the multiprotocol nature of ONTAP which allows access to the same data from Windows and Linux Clients. 

NOTE: The security style set on your volume determines the permissions that will be enforced for user authentication. Volume security style is inherited from the security style of the root volume of your SVM. During the SVM creation you can choose between Unix, NTFS or Mixed security styles.

Even when a volume uses UNIX security style, SMB clients can still access data due to the multiprotocol nature of ONTAP provided they can properly authenticate and authorize the user credentials.  The security style only determines the type of permissions ONTAP uses to control access to data and what type of client can modify the permissions. 

* Setting the security style to *Unix* enforces Unix style permissions. Use this if you are administering the volumes from Unix hosts or if your data volumes are primarily going to be accessed from Unix based servers.  
* If you are administering your volumes from Windows or if the data is primarily used by Windows applications set the security style to *NTFS*. 
* If the security style is set to *mixed*, then either Unix or NTFS permissions can be used on files and directories. The effective permissions are based on whichever type of client last modified the permissions.

. Return to the SSH connection of the *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance*.
+
TIP: If the session has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the  session window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. Connect using AWS Systems Manager - *_Select_* *Session Manager* tab and *_click_* the Connect button to open a session in your browser (*recommended*). Alternately, SSH using Terminal client - *_Select_* *SSH client* tab and *_Copy_* the Example SSH command shown and *_click_* Close. ** *_Open_* your terminal application and *_paste_* the SSH command in a terminal window. ** *_Follow_* the prompts to SSH into the instance.
+
. *_Run_* the following command to see if any NFS volumes have been mounted.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount | grep  nfs

----
+

. Do you see any NFS volumes have been mounted?

NOTE: No volumes should be mounted at this time.

. *_Copy_* the script below into your favorite text editor. Replace the mount point if needed.
+
[source,bash]
----
MOUNTPOINT=/fsx
sudo mkdir ${MOUNTPOINT}
sudo mount -t nfs ${NFSENDPOINT}:/vol1 ${MOUNTPOINT}
----
+
. *_Run_* below command to set the *user:group* for the mount point.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user ${MOUNTPOINT}
----
+
. *_Return_* to the SSH connection of the *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance*.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the SSH connection window and create a new one.
+
. *_Paste_* and run the script you copied to the clipboard in the SSH connection window.

. *_Run_* below command to confirm your file system was successfully mounted.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount | grep ${MOUNTPOINT}
----
+
. What is the NFS version used by default to mount the file system?

. How do you mount the file system with a different NFS version?

. *_Run_* below command to mount the file system using *NFS version 3* or customize the default mount options.
+
[source,bash]
----
V3MOUNT=/fsxnfsv3
sudo mkdir ${V3MOUNT}
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3 ${NFSENDPOINT}:/vol1 ${V3MOUNT}
----
+
. *_Run_* below command to confirm your file system was successfully mounted.
+
[source,bash]
----
mount | grep ${V3MOUNT}
----
+
* You should see the volume mounted with NFS version 3.
+
. *_Run_* below command to unmount the NFSv3 mount.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo umount ${V3MOUNT}
----
+
. *_Copy_* the script below and run the script to create a new directory and file in your NFS mount.
+
[source,bash]
----
DIRNAME=multiprotocol
mkdir ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}
echo "This file is used for multi-protocol access demo" >> ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/multiprotocol-demo.txt
cat ${MOUNTPOINT}/${DIRNAME}/multiprotocol-demo.txt
----
+


== Step-by-step Guide (Create a CIFS share)

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video if available before continuing.

. *_Return_* to the SSH connection of your *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux Instance* and SSH to the file system management endpoint of your primary file system to create a *ONTAP CLI* session.
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh ${ADMINUSER}@${MGMTENDPOINT}
----
+
. *_Create_* a *CIFS share* to share the *multiprotocol* directory using CIFS/SMB protocol with Windows Clients. 
+
[source,bash]
----
vserver cifs share create -vserver svm08 -share-name multiprotocol -path /vol1/multiprotocol
----
+
. *Run* below command to check if the share was created successfully. 
+
[source,bash]
----
vserver cifs share show -vserver svm08
----
+
. You should be able to see the */vol1/multiprotocol* exported as *_CIFS share_* with name *multiprotocol*.

TIP: If you created a SVM with NTFS or MIXED security style then you can create CIFS share from an Windows EC2 Instance ( *_Run_* *fsmgmt.msc* -> *_Right-click_* *Connect to another computer* and Enter the SMB DNS name for your SVM. *_Right-click_*  on *shares* -> *new share* and follow the steps to create a new share.


== Step-by-step Guide (Map share to Windows Instance)

=== Map share to Windows Instance


. *_Launch_* *File Explorer*.

. *_Context-click (right-click)_* *This PC* and *_select_* *Map network drive...*

. Map the file share using the following information:
+
[cols="3,10"]
|===
| *Drive*
a| Z:

| *Folder*
a| This is the UNC path of *multiprotocol* share. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_click_* the link to the *primary* file system and *_select_* the *Storage virtual machines* tab. *_Click_* *SVM Name* and then *_click_* the image:copy-to-clipboard.png[align="left",width=20] shortcut next to the *SMB DNS name* to *_copy_* the *SMB DNS Name* to the clipboard and paste it as the first part of the UNC path. *_Add_* *\multiprotocol* to the end of the *SMB DNS Name* to complete the UNC path to the multiprotocol share. (e.g. \\svm08.example.com\multiprotocol).

| *Reconnect at sign-in*
a| Leave checked

| *Connect using different credentials*
a| Leave unchecked
|===
+
. In the *File Explorer* window of the *Z:* drive you should see the file *multiprotocol-demo.txt* which was created on the NFS mount point on your Linux instance.

. *_Double-Click_* to open the file *multiprotocol-demo.txt* and see if you can read the contents of the file.
